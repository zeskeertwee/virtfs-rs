The Cat
=======

No need to introduce the cat;
You've got one lying on your mat.
Ailurophobe, of course, do not.
They'd rather see cats hanged or shot.

The cat detractors can't abide
The creatures overweening pride.
Admirers of the feline praise
His occult, incandescent gaze.

Both sides have merit--and the view
Endorsed by mice is also true.
